A simple web application built with javascript and php

I used Debian in a virtual machine as a server and the MVC pattern. I should host it somewhere for it to make more sense as a part 
of my portfolio, but I am quite busy now and I don't plan on doing web applications as a job. You can still look at the code, as far 
as I remember it's quite clean and readable. Just trust me it works.😁
